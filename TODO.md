## ðŸ“‹ To Do

- [ ] Make an options page where the user can choose how URLs are copied to the title (eg. regex matching, hostname only, etc.), and maybe even which URLs the user wants the extension to work on
- [ ] Add an option where, instead of a simple timer, the URL disappears from the tab title after `Enter` is pressed (could be customizable? but it can't use the commands API since that would require the shortcut to be 2-3 keys - see [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/commands) )
